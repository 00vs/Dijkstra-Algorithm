# Dijkstra-Algorithm
Dijkstra's algorithm is a powerful method for finding the shortest path from a single source vertex to all other vertices in a weighted graph.

It is primarily a greedy algorithm, as it searches for the immediate optimal choice at each step, but it also incorporates some elements of dynamic programming, by storing solutions to subproblems and using them to find the overall solution. 
Dijkstra's algorithm has many practical applications, such as GPS navigation, network bandwidth optimization, and AI game character development.
